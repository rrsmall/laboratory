            students in exploring the exciting field of cybersecurity, sparking them to
            consider cybersecurity as a field for study at the collegiate level,
            and ultimately creating a pipeline of a diverse pool of highly qualified
            students to fill the shortage of professionals to work in this field.
            Students will be introduced to cybersecurity best practices as well as
            the underlying scientific principles that have generated those practices.
            Hands-on activities are designed to be both educational and fun for high
          school students.</small>
